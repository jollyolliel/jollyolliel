# Who am I

Hi! I am primarily a backend programmer, but recently trying a bit of frontend. I don't like it at all. I am at school and I think it is **OK**. I can't wait until the summer holidays! I started programming and the age of 7 and continued since then. I have always found it interesting to build your own stuff.
